For a page with a custom layout, add to YAML matter like so::
---
layout: custom-layout-name
---



These are the page templates which include such things as everything in the <head> tag and including the <body> tags

Currently the 'default.html' template also has the <script src="/js/app-min.js"></script>, but that could technically be moved to a file such as src/partials/scripts.html

It would then be imported into the 'default.html' template via ::
{{> scripts}}


SO
Anthing that you want to have imported into said 'default.html' template is done so with the following tag ::
{{> _____}}
It does NOT include the file extension of the imported file
